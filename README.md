# HealthFormSender
Simulates filling out the Ministry of Health's health declaration form for Preschool 

The "healthDeclarationRequest" variable contains the JSON that would have been created when filling out the web form manually. 
I suggest doing it once manually and capturing the values sent and then copying those values into the code. Especially relevant for gettings the Maon details which includes Maon code.
